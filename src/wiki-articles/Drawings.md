Welcome to the **Draw** section of PaintBloatware! Here, you can create your own pixel art by writing **Lua code**. This is your playground for turning logic into visual art.

---

## How It Works

- **Code your image:** Write Lua scripts to set the color of individual pixels or create patterns.
- **Run:** Click the **Run** button to execute your code and see the result in the preview canvas instantly.
- **Step:** Use the **Step** button to add multiple frames to your artwork, perfect for animations or sequences.
- **Post:** When youâ€™re happy with your creation, click **Post** to share it on your profile with the community.

## Code Snippets

Below the drawing area, you will find the **Code Snippets** section. These are pre-made examples to help you get started:

- **Blue-Red Diagonal Gradient**: Creates a diagonal gradient shifting from red to blue.
- **Checkerboard Pattern**: Draws a classic checkerboard pattern using alternating blocks.
- **Jake the Dog**: Draws Jake the Dog with geometric shapes and color fills.
- **Eye**: Draws a stylized eye using a pixel sprite and color palette.
- **Color Gradient**: Creates a smooth color gradient from corner to corner.
- **Green Horizontal Stripes**: Creates alternating green stripes across the image.
- **Orange Circle in the Center**: Draws a bright orange circle on a dark bluish background.
- **Soft Blue Noise Texture**: Generates a fog-like blue noise texture with random brightness.
- **Sine Waves**: Generates colorful sine wave patterns across the grid.
- **Yellow Dotted Grid**: Draws yellow dots evenly spaced on a dark background.

> Tip: Use these snippets as building blocks or modify them to experiment with your own creative ideas.

Now youâ€™re ready! Start coding, preview your artwork, and share your creations with the PaintBloatware community.
