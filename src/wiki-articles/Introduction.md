# Team PaintBloatware ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’»

Welcome to **PaintBloatware**, a project by our talented team who loves combining **code and visual creativity**.

We built a web platform where users can **code their own images** and **share them with the community**, like an Instagram for code-generated art.

## Our team:

- **Santino GarcÃ­a Corsaro**
- **Lisandro GarcÃ­a Seminara**
- **Bruno Malasio**
- **Juan Ignacio Dragan**
- **Benicio VerdÃºn**

Together, we imagined a platform where **logic meets aesthetics**, giving coders a canvas to create, explore, and share.

## What You Can Do

- **Code your images** using Lua snippets.
- **Preview your work instantly** on the canvas.
- **Upload and share** your creations with the community feed.
- **Explore and remix** other users' art to spark new ideas.

## Why PaintBloatware?

We wanted to give programmers and artists a **space to express themselves visually**, blending code and creativity. Whether youâ€™re a beginner or a professional, **PaintBloatware makes creating and sharing visual code fun and intuitive**.
